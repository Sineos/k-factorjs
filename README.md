# k-factorjs
Script to generate a test g-code for k-factor calibration in Marlin LIN_ADVANCE

The code should be self explanatory if you know what LIN_ADVANCE is.

This script was inspired by https://mattshub.com/2017/10/02/linear-advance/ (look for the script by Sebastianv650)
All credits for the idea go to token47 (https://github.com/token47/k-factor)
